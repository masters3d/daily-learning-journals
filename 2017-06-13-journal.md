# Day7

Today we leaned about prototypes and how ES5 makes classes works by overriding the prototype of the constructor function. 


* [x] user constructors
* [x] each store needs a render() that renders to the table
* [x] header should have a render() method
* [x] footer should have a render() method
* [x] a row of totals for each row


Streatch goal:

* Second table with Cookie Tosser
* Minimum 2 at all times
* 1 tosser can serve 20 customers at hour
*
