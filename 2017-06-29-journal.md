 today will learn how to not implement features that were not done. We have implemented a feature that was meant to check if the user was already in the database but this ended up breaking up the code so we had to remove it 
  we also got to present the final product as a practice run. We found a lot of bugs on our practice run so we ended up fixing those bags instead of practicing. Tomorrow we will present to the team at 4 PM .
