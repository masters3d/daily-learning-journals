## Day1
We learned about Semantic HTML5. Instead of using DIV we can use special tags like Section, Footer etc. We were introduced to Git. 

#Day2
I have used git before but I was challenged to wireup my own remotes. We went over CSS and JS5. I am going to use ES2015+ in my code because I think this is the best thing to do. I think what I do not like most about JS5 is that `var` is always global while `let` is more sensable.
