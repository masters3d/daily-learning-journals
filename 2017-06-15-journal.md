# Day 9

We learned about some HR stuff yesterday because we are part of cohort. We went over communications. Aside from learning the technical things about JS. The most important skill is actually interaction with other developers.
* How to explain what you code is doing
* how to ask  questions about other peoples code.
* ask for help when you get stuck.
* do not be afraid to ask questions or interrupt people if you are stuck. It depends on the organization, sometimes this can be done with in slack.

Today we are going to learn about CSS grid systems.
