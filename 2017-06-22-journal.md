# Day 14

Today we learned about the way CSS works with animations and other related animation things like the way we are able to tell CSS to move something by using key frames.
There are so many options. I was impressed by some of the CSS code that is able to draw complete darwings based on CSS olone. I though that the platforms is doing great specally because all these animations are being achieved without the use of JS.
