# LJ Code 301 Day 6

## Stretch Goals (not required):

- [ ]  As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- [ ] Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a [type scale](http://type-scale.com/)(another good [type scale article](http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography)).
- [ ] Include some good fonts, that work well together.


Today I learned how to see all the remote branches on a repo. Thanks to this link http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/13/list-remote-branches.html

`$ git branch -r`
