# LJ Code 301 Day 6

Today I learned how to see all the remote branches on a repo. Thanks to this link http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/13/list-remote-branches.html

`$ git branch -r`


## Feedback from review

  #### User Stories Point Penalties::
- [x]  (- 1) There is no Home nav link. It needs to hide all the sections and show the home section.
- [x]  (- 1) There is no About nav link. I needs to hide all the sections and show the about section.
- [x]  (- 1) the Home and About nav links can't navigate to a new page or reload the current page.


## User Stories: MVP

- [x]  As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
- [x]  As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.
- [x] Move JSON to the a folder called data.


## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [x]  Transfer your collection of data over to a .json file, replacing your original file.
- [x]  JSON-Lint to the res3cue!
- [x]  Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
- [x]  Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
- [x]  Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!

## Stretch Goals (not required):

- [x] Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a [type scale](http://type-scale.com/)(another good [type scale article](http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography)).
