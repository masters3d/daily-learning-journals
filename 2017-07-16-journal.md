# LJ Code 301 - Sunday

## User Stories: MVP
- [x] As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
- [x] As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
- [x] This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
- [x] Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
- [x] Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
- [x] As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visual

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [x] Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
- [x] Add click handlers to at least one nav section.
- [x] Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
- [x] When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no `$('#content .content')` nonsense!
- [x] For bonus points, include styles for tablet displays, as well as desktop and mobile.
- [x] Organize your CSS code according to SMACSS, with at least a file for base, layout, and modules.


## Stretch Goals (not required):
NOTE: I did by hiding all the images.
- [x] As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
- [x] As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
- [x] As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
