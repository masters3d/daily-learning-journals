# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

## User Stories: MVP
- [ ] As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.
- [ ] As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
- [ ] This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
- [ ] Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
- [ ] Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
- [ ] As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visual

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [ ] Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
- [ ] Add click handlers to at least one nav section.
- [ ] Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
- [ ] When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no `$('#content .content')` nonsense!
- [ ] For bonus points, include styles for tablet displays, as well as desktop and mobile.
- [x] Add Handlebars to your blogging system.
- [ ] Organize your CSS code according to SMACSS, with at least a file for base, layout, and modules.


## Stretch Goals (not required):
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
- [ ] As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
- [ ] As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
- [ ] As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
- [ ]  As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- [ ] Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a [type scale](http://type-scale.com/)(another good [type scale article](http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography)).
- [ ] Include some good fonts, that work well together.
