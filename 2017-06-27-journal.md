Today we reached MVP with our team. It was interesting how some of the team was really interesting in some features while at the same time I was equality uninterested. It was great coming to an agreement on what worked best. I liked how the handle it and I felt that my team understood that event thought they did not see it my way they wanted to make sure I felt heard. Software is hard but not as hard as peopleware.
