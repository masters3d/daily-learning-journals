# Day 21

Today was a hard day because I was overthinking it.

NonPro Tip: Do not overthink the implementation. <-This was me today. Made the problem harder than it needed to be by saving to the storage at every click.

The performace of my program went down to a crawl because I was working work json and this seem to be a really slow.
It was frustating but all I had to do was to step back and start up again on another branch. I had done so much work on the previous branch already but my approach was flawed. I was prettty much trying to treat localStore memoery the same way as running memory. This is the sencond time that I've gone a rabbits hole trying to fin the best implemenentation.
