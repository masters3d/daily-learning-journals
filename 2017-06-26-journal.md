Today we started our new game project with our team. We combined everybody's ideas into something we could work on that could make a nice looking game. I learned how to replace the images of button based on when the button is being click. I also learned that I can add images to each keyframe of an animation. I also learned that there is a random function in CSS that I need to learn more about. I was very happy that we got to use the same ideas that we had already employed in the pass.

I still can't center anything vertically reliably in css.
Something interesting is that If there are commit conflicts and I fixed the conflicts but do not make the changed file as resolved then the entire file changes get committed to the repo but only the file changes which is good.
