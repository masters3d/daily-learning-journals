# Day 8

Today we learned that when we are doing check boxes we should wrap the boxes inside the a label because this will allow us to be able to make the click event happens on the label so people do not have to worry about people not being able to click on the small box because now the surface area is bigger.

Another thing that we can do is reorganized the way that the box is shown. We can then just shows the box first then the label.
