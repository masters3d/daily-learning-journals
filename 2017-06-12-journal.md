Today we learned about object literals. Something I think that is intersting about objects in js is that they can be querried using the []. This is interesting because this feature is called reflection in other laguages. In Swift this kind of querry is called KeyValuePath where we give the object a KeyValuePath that we are intersted about and the lanague is able to give us a strongly typed thing that we can ask the object about. The main difference here is that Swift knows if the key exists on the object before actually running the code. 

I also learned about the way the JS gets loaded. It is better to have the JS tag be at the bottom or have the "onLoad" function kick in after the HTML has been loaded. This is because if we try to access the dom before the dom has been loaded then.
