Today we learned about object literals. Something I think that is intersting about objects in js is that they can be querried using the []. This is interesting because this feature is called reflection in other laguages. In Swift this kind of querry is called KeyValuePath where we give the object a KeyValuePath that we are intersted about and the lanague is able to give us a strongly typed thing that we can ask the object about. The main difference here is that Swift knows if the key exists on the object before actually running the code.
