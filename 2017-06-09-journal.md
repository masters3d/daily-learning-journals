# Day 5

Today we learned about branching. We used a couple of different git command to keep different features in other branches. I think something interesting when it comes to git branches is that they are not complete units of code but intead each git branch is actually under the hood just another commit. Son a sence we only really have once version of the code al all times even if we have a bunch of different branches. A branch it is only a speical commit that branches out the commit history. Another thing that I head linus say is that all the code in a repo is treated as one unit so that git does not really care about files intead git only cares about code unit. 

Another quick little command I leaned today off Stack overfow  is being able to push all the branches at the same time. 

* `git push --all origin`
