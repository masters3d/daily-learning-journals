Today we learned some about JS way of executing and debugging.

During the lab I learned how to work with other team mates. This was something that I think is very valuable because even If I learn all the technical things about JS, I still need to know how to work together in a team.

* I also learned bout the after and before:: css psudo objects.
* During the css chocolate pizza project I was able to figure out how to created a solid like with a middle image.
* I also leaned how to give an element a repeating background.
* I did not get to finish the project but we did place all the content on the page.

I reused my grid system but instead we only used rows.

I did not like how JS hoisting works. I think this can lead to bugs specially since I have to alway keep track of witch variables i already used in a foo loop etc.
