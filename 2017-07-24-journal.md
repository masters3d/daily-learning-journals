# LJ Code 301 Day 11

We learnt about how to fake the path of the page using client side libraries.
This was a very interesting way of faking a single page app as if they were different app. I think this was really cool specially because it allows us to make paths that people could potentially use to get to the different parts of the application with out having to remember to navigate there. I also thought that this was a really good hack because it would seem that this change is only there recently with HTML5.

We had a temp instructor today. I like having 3 breaks and we actually get to get out 30 mins early which gave us a lot of time to get the lab done. This might have been orchestrated by our instructor because there was a meetup some people wanted to go.
