# LJ Code 301 Day 13

Today we got to deploy to a back end using heroku. I appreciated being able to deploy something using JS on the back end. I had worked on the pass with google App engine but compared that that Heroku is supper easy. It was a great experience plus I really liked the look of the site, it was  great experience. I am excited about the next step on this journey because I really like back end stuff.
