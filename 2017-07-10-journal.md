# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Today we learned about working together and some more jQuerry. I liked working together in pairs. I think what we get to learn at codefellows is how to interact with our fellow students. The material that we are learning is fairly straight forward because we can get the information we need from places like udacity but it is very hard to get the same kind of interaction with students when we are doing all the learning online. There is a great deal of things that we can only learn when we actually work. This kind of learning is hard to teach on an all online kind of class. It is hard to explain things because as humans we want to read peoples expressions when they are saying something because we want to make sure that they tone is he one we expect. Some of this kind of tone can be captured on a phone call or a live session over screen sharing site but it does feel somewhat disconnected. I also think our brain gets happy when we work as pack together because we are social animal perhaps our brains evolved to reward us with serotonin when we work together because it knows that we will have a higher rate of success when we are in groups.
