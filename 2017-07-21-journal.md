# LJ Code 301 Day 10

We learned about immediately invoked JS and some other back end things during the lab.
We practiced on all the ES6 things along with functional higher other functions like forEach, .map , .reduce etc.

I liked the brain bending things like IFFE that take an object in order to make a app feel a lot more like a package.
