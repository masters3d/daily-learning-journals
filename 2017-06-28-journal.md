Today we worked on more stretch goals for the game. We added a lot of functionality to the options page. I learned that all id objects from html are accessible in java with out having to search for the id with a method. I found this helpful because we can then not have to worry about declaring variables. This may not seem like a good thing for some reason but this is js and I think this kind of versatility is great. I am getting to like JS a lot more and I think it is great that now I've been forced to learn JS 5. I am hoping that when we get to use ES2017 we can hopefully use some of the async features that could easily match together with C#
