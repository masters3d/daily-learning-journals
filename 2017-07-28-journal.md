# LJ Code 301 Day 15

This is probably going to be my last journal for this repo. I had a team meeting for the last project of code fellows. I had the idea of getting the journals from everybody and put them on a page so everybody could see them. My team thought that it was weird to have a place like this for all the journals because they were suppose to be private but they are not private. These journals are public. They are accessible to anybody with a browser. I think it was funny because this things are public but I do understand that some things some people put in these is probably not the most awesome so some people might be embarrassed to have the journals out there for people to read. idk. I hated the ideas of having this. I was thinking for a project we could run sentiment analysis and only show positive entries. If I am bored, maybe I will still build it. :)

1) What is AJAX? Describe why it is asynchronous.

* AJAX is a way to make requests while not having to reload a page. It is async because we do not want to block other calls from going out.

2) Describe 3 features that make AJAX useful, one to two sentences per feature.

* We do not have to reload a page to get new data.
* Updates can happen to our webpages without the user noticing. Think the way CNN would display a breaking news banner.
* We can refresh the localStorage in a way to minimize the actual requests to the server and still keep the localStorage data fresh.

3) Propose an idea for a website that relies on jQuery and AJAX, a website that you'd be able to create from scratch in the near future.

* A portfolio site that get all its information from Linked-In and GitHub to create a page. This can also be done for videos where the page only knows the link for the video but it will load the name and description of the video.

4) Write at least one "user story" -- a sentence or two that describes a benefit to users that visit your proposed site.

* As a user I want to always get the most update to day information specially if the source pages get updated. This way the portfolio sites are always up to date.

5) Write at least one "developer story" -- a sentence or two that describes how AJAX would help you, as a developer, implement the site to make the user story come true.

* As a developer I do not want to concern myself with maintaining two versions of the data. I want to have a once source for the data that I can cache on my server and only periodically update.
