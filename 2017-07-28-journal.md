# LJ Code 301 Day 15

This is probably going to be my last journal for this repo. I had a team meeting for the last project of code fellows. I had the idea of getting the journals from everybody and put them on a page so everybody could see them. My team thought that it was weird to have a place like this for all the journals because they were suppose to be private but they are not private. These journals are public. They are accessible to anybody with a browser. I think it was funny because this things are public but I do understand that some things some people put in these is probably not the most awsome so some people might be embarrased to have the journals out there for people to read. idk. I hated the ideas of having this. I was thinking for a project we could run sentiment analisis and only show positive entries. If I am bored, maybe I will still build it. :)
