## Day 20

Today we practiced the presentation of the game a couple of times. We also had a couple of times to practice the way we shocased the different features. 
This was a greate way to work on stage fraight. I think the more practire we have the easier it will be to get other the fact that we are showing this content to other people. 
Since the other people in the audience are also in the same shoes as use then it doesnt make sence to feel afraid because everebody probably feels the same.
