# LJ Code 301 Day 8

Yesterday we learned about servers and how to run our code using express. I really like the ability to be able to run my work on the server.

We also learned about how to work with PostGres. I had only worked with MySql before so it is nice to get exposure with other SQL databases. I know some sql but I don't really use it much so most of the knowledge erodes away with time. I am enjoying the discussions and it is cool to learn front end web development.
