# LJ Code 301 - Day 2

These are the items I worked on yesterday. I also worked on a blog project that is meant to teach me how to create a similar site but that can be used as a portfolio site for employment prospects.

## Pre-work
- [x] Start a fresh new repository for this project on GitHub.
- [x] pen & paper "wireframe" sketch of what you want your portfolio site to look like.
- [x] Make a JS constructor function to model your project data. Think about what properties you would need to accurately model a coding project.
- [x] Work through as many of the user stories as you can, but always submit what you have by the due date. Don't let "if only..." ideas keep you from turning something in
- [x] add the .eslintrc config file to the root of your repo, so we are all on the same linter settings.
- [x] Also include a .[gitignore]

## MVP
- [x] As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
- [x] As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.


### Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [x] Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects that contains properties appropriate for a portfolio project.
- [x] Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- [x] Use strict mode in all .js files.
- [x] When you have finished your wireframes and data model, present them to the instructors for approval.
