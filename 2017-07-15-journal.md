# LJ Code 301 MeetUp

Today I cam to a meet up at code fellows. We learned about Unity and C# and how they are used to create virtual reality experiences with the HoloLens and HVC vive kind of devices. Unity uses C# to create scrips that run on game and they allow the different objects to do different things depending on the script. Once of the instructors named Adam let me borrow his charger because I forget mine at home.

I got to talked to somebody name Mark who has a background in math. I told him about aprrentti and he was very excited that something like that existed. He has done web stuff before but is not really interested in doing web stuff but really wants to get into technologies like VR. He is currently not working in the tech industry but he does want to start.

I also met a student to Japan who just moved to Seattle to start at UW as a Computer Science student. He was very interested in technical topics. He liked Seattle because he thought everybody was very nice. We talked about japan thing and a little bit about Ruby.

One of the presenters name Joe showed me his game he did on the phone using a game controller. We also checked out some other game they made that was very simple with UFO. I also made a simple game that shoots UFO when a key is pressed.
