# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Today I was able to reach most of my MVP. I stayed at the office until 7pm to get some of the stretch goals. This was fun as there was still some other students here trying to figure out some of the most challenging things.


## MVP
- [x] As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
- [x] As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
- [x] As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
- [x] As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
- [x] As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## Stretch Goals
- [x] As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.
- [x] As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

### Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [x] Include a CSS reset
- [x] The nav menu should be hidden by default in mobile mode and should display when the user clicks the hamburger icon.
- [x] Be sure to use proper viewport settings.
- [x] Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
- [x] Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.
- [x] Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its **own file**! Build out an array of three objects to   start with, all having similar properties.
- [x] Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:
- [x] Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.
- [x] Leave as little in the `window` (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- [x] Use jQuery to `clone` the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.
- [x] Your "Project" prototype should have a `.toHtml()` function that adds new data to the DOM.
- [x] Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.
