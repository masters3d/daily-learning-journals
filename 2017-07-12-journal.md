# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

## MVP

- [ ] As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
- [ ] As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

### Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
