# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

## MVP

- [ ] As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
- [ ] As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

### Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [ ] Include a CSS reset
- [ ] The nav menu should be hidden by default in mobile mode and should display when the user clicks the hamburger icon.
- [ ] Be sure to use proper viewport settings.
- [ ] Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
- [ ] Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.
- [ ] For bonus points, include styles for tablet displays, as well as desktop and mobile.
- [ ] Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its **own file**! Build out an array of three objects to   start with, all having similar properties.
- [ ] Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:
- [ ] Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.
- [ ] Leave as little in the `window` (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- [ ] Use jQuery to `clone` the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.
- [ ] Your "Project" prototype should have a `.toHtml()` function that adds new data to the DOM.
- [ ] Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.
