# LJ Code 301 Day 7

## Stretch Goals (not required):

- [ ] Add readme with more of the showcase what i am different.

- [ ]  As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls.
- [ ]  As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- [ ] Include some good fonts, that work well together.
