# LJ Code 301 Day 7

I tried getting some documentation going today with my branch but I was not able to stand up the html generation using sphinx-js. Perhaps I will just keep commenting at a minimum. Something Else I want to do is create tests.

## Stretch Goals (not required):

- [x] Add readme with more of the showcase what i am different.
- [ ]  As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
- [ ] Include some good fonts, that work well together.
